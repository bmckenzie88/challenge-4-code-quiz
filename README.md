# Coding Quiz
This repo is for a quiz that was built from scratch where my understanding of JavaSript and Jquery is applied through an interactive quiz.

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to develop an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and Jquery.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the quiz, first click the "Start!" button. You will then be presented with a timer in the upper right-hand corner, starting at 90 seconds. You will also be presented with a multiple-choice question. When you click on one of the answers, you will then be presented with another question. For each wrong answer that you choose, the timer will change by a decrement of 15 seconds. When the timer reaches zero, or when you answer the last questions, the game will end and you will be prompted to enter your initals.

Once you have entered your initials and clicked "submit", you will be taken to the highscores page where you can see your score and any other scores that have been stored. You can then return to the quiz or clear the highscores by clicking one of the buttons at the bottom of the highscores list.
